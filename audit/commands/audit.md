description: Deep code audit — security, tests, architecture, performance, stack-specific checks
argument-hint: [--changed | --since <commit/date> | security | tests | architecture | performance | ux | costs | <custom>]
---

Run a structured code audit on this project. Adapts to the detected stack.

**Modes:**
- `/audit` — full audit, all relevant axes, all files
- `/audit security` (or tests, architecture, etc.) — full audit, single axis
- `/audit --changed` — incremental: only files changed since the last audit report
- `/audit --since abc123` — incremental: only files changed since the given commit or date
- `/audit --changed security` — incremental + single axis

## Step 1 — Context & scope

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (project root or `.claude/`). If none exists:
   - Tell the user: "No CLAUDE.md found. Run `/audit-conf` first to generate one, then re-run `/audit`."
   - Stop.

2. From CLAUDE.md, extract:
   - **Stack** (languages, frameworks, DB, infra)
   - **Build/test commands**
   - **Project conventions**

3. Check for previous audit reports:
   - `ls -t audit-reports/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1`
   - If found → note the filename and its date, used for delta comparison in Step 7

4. Parse arguments and determine mode:

   **Incremental mode** (if `--changed` or `--since` in arguments):
   - `--changed`: find the date of the last audit report. If none exists, tell the user "No previous audit found — running full audit instead." and fall back to full mode.
     Get changed files: `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR $(git log --since="YYYY-MM-DD" --format=%H | tail -1)..HEAD` (using the last report date)
   - `--since <ref>`: get changed files: `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR <ref>..HEAD`
   - Store the list of changed files. These will be the ONLY files explored and reviewed.
   - If 0 changed files → tell user "No files changed since [ref]. Nothing to audit." and stop.
   - Remaining arguments after `--changed`/`--since <ref>` are treated as axis filter.

   **Full mode** (default):
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided (and not `--changed`/`--since`) → audit ONLY that axis
   - If no argument → auto-detect relevant axes (see Step 2)

## Step 2 — Detect relevant axes

Based on the stack and project structure, select which axes to audit.

**Always included (any stack):**
- **Tests** — coverage gaps, weak assertions, missing edge cases, fragile tests
- **Security** — secrets in code, injection risks, input validation, dependency vulnerabilities
- **Architecture** — layering violations, DRY, coupling, pattern consistency
- **Error handling** — silent failures, broad exceptions, unhelpful error messages

**Include if detected:**
- **Performance** — if DB/ORM present: N+1 queries, missing indexes, unbounded queries. If async: race conditions.
- **Data integrity** — if ETL/pipeline/import code present
- **UX** — if frontend framework detected (Streamlit, Flutter, React, etc.)
- **API costs** — if LLM/SaaS API calls detected (OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, etc.)
- **Deployment** — if Docker, CI/CD, systemd, Caddy files present

**Estimate project size** to calibrate agent count:
- Count source files (exclude tests, config, generated): `find src/ lib/ app/ . -maxdepth 3 -name "*.py" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.dart" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.rs" | grep -v test | grep -v __pycache__ | grep -v node_modules | wc -l`
- **Small** (< 20 files): 2 agents (merge reviewers 1+2, keep 3)
- **Medium** (20-80 files): 3 agents (reviewers 1, 2, 3)
- **Large** (> 80 files): 4 agents (all reviewers)

Present the selected axes to the user:
```
AUDIT PLAN — [project name]
Stack: [detected stack]
Mode: [full / incremental (X files changed since YYYY-MM-DD)]
Size: [X source files] → [small/medium/large] (or X changed files in incremental)
Axes: [list of selected axes]
Agents: [1-4] review agents
Previous audit: [date of last report, or "none"]

Proceed? [Y/n]
```

Wait for confirmation before launching agents.

## Step 3 — Exploration phase

**Incremental mode:** Skip the Explore agent entirely. The changed files list IS the audit map.
Classify each changed file into the relevant axes based on its path and content (quick read of first 20 lines).
This saves ~2 minutes on incremental audits.

**Full mode:** Launch **1 agent** (subagent_type: `Explore`, thoroughness: "very thorough"):

**Mission:** Map the codebase for the audit. For each selected axis, identify which files
are relevant. Produce a structured map:

```
AUDIT MAP
├── Tests: [list of test files + source files with no test coverage]
├── Security: [auth files, route handlers, config files, env handling]
├── Architecture: [core modules, services, models, entry points]
├── Error handling: [same files as architecture + API clients]
├── Performance: [DB queries, ORM models, async code, batch operations]
├── [other axes]: [relevant files]
```

This map is the INPUT for the review agents. No file should be audited blindly.

## Step 4 — Review phase

Launch agents in parallel (subagent_type: `feature-dev:code-reviewer`).
Number of agents determined by project size (Step 2).

Split the axes across agents to minimize file overlap:

| Agent | Axes | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Reviewer 1 | Security + Error handling | Auth, routes, input handling, config, API clients |
| Reviewer 2 | Tests + Robustness | Test files, source files with gaps, edge cases |
| Reviewer 3 | Architecture + Performance | Core logic, services, models, DB queries |
| Reviewer 4 | Stack-specific (if applicable) | UX, data integrity, API costs, deployment |

**Sizing rules:**
- **Incremental (< 15 changed files):** 1-2 agents max. Merge all axes into 1 agent if < 5 files.
- **Small project (< 20 source files):** merge Reviewers 1+2 into a single agent, skip Reviewer 4.
- **Medium project (20-80 files):** skip Reviewer 4 unless stack-specific axes are critical.
- **Large project (> 80 files):** all 4 reviewers.

Each agent receives:
1. The audit map (their relevant files ONLY)
2. The CLAUDE.md stack conventions
3. Clear instructions:

```
You are auditing [project name] ([stack]).
Your axes: [list].
Files to review: [list from audit map].

For each finding, report:
- **Severity**: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- **Category**: BUG / SECURITY / ROBUSTNESS / PERFORMANCE / COST / UX / ARCHITECTURE
- **File:line**: exact location
- **Description**: what's wrong (1-2 sentences)
- **Evidence**: the problematic code snippet
- **Suggestion**: how to fix it (1-2 sentences)

CRITICAL/HIGH findings MUST include evidence (code snippet).
Do NOT report style issues or nitpicks — only real problems.
Do NOT report issues that the project's linter/analyzer would already catch.
```

## Step 5 — CTO consolidation

After all agents return, act as CTO. For each finding:

**CRITICAL/HIGH findings:**
- Read the actual file at the reported line
- Verify the finding is real (not a false positive, not already handled elsewhere)
- If false positive → reject with 1-line justification
- If confirmed → keep, classify

**MEDIUM/LOW findings:**
- Accept as-is (no re-verification — trust the reviewer for lower severity)
- Still classify

**Feature suggestions** (things that aren't bugs but could be better):
- Separate into a "Feature suggestions" section
- Do NOT create tickets — present for discussion

## Step 6 — Create tickets

For each confirmed finding:

| Category | Ticket type | Auto-create? |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| BUG / SECURITY (CRITICAL/HIGH) | BUG | Yes |
| BUG / SECURITY (MEDIUM/LOW) | BUG | Yes |
| ROBUSTNESS / ARCHITECTURE / PERFORMANCE | IMP | Yes |
| COST / UX | IMP | Yes |
| Feature suggestion | — | No (discussion) |

**Respect project conventions:**
- If `BACKLOG/` exists → create tickets there (scan existing IDs, anti-conflict)
- If no `BACKLOG/` → skip ticket creation, just present findings in report
- Use `/backlog-bug` and `/backlog-imp` patterns for ticket format

## Step 7 — Report

Generate the report and save to `audit-reports/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md`.

**The filename MUST include the hour and minute** (e.g., `2026-03-26_14-30.md`).
Use `date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M` to generate it. Never use date-only filenames — multiple audits per day would collide.

```markdown
# Audit Report — [project name]
**Date:** [full timestamp]
**Stack:** [detected stack]
**Mode:** [full / incremental (X files changed since ref)]
**Scope:** [X source files (full) or X changed files (incremental)]
**Axes audited:** [list]
**Agents used:** [count]
**Duration:** [total time from start to report generation]

## Delta from previous audit

[If a previous report exists in audit-reports/:]
- Previous audit: [date]
- New findings: X (not in previous report)
- Resolved since last audit: X (in previous report, no longer found)
- Recurring: X (still present)

[If no previous report:] "First audit — no comparison available."

## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | X |
| HIGH     | X |
| MEDIUM   | X |
| LOW      | X |

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| BUG      | X |
| SECURITY | X |
| ...      | X |

## CRITICAL & HIGH findings

### [FINDING-1] [Category] — [short title]
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **File:** `path/to/file:line`
- **Ticket:** BUG-XXX (created)
- **Description:** ...
- **Evidence:** ```code snippet```
- **Suggestion:** ...
- **Verified:** ✅ confirmed by CTO review

### [FINDING-2] ...

## MEDIUM & LOW findings

| # | Severity | Category | File | Description | Ticket |
|---|----------|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | MEDIUM | ... | ... | ... | IMP-XXX |
| 2 | LOW | ... | ... | ... | IMP-XXX |

## Rejected findings (false positives)

| # | Original finding | Rejection reason |
|---|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | ... | ... |

## Feature suggestions (for discussion)

- [Suggestion 1 — description + rationale]
- [Suggestion 2]

## Recommended treatment order

1. [TICKET-ID] (SEVERITY) — [why first: impact, quick win, dependency]
2. [TICKET-ID] (SEVERITY) — [reason]
3. ...

Group quick wins (XS complexity) that can be batched together.

## Tickets created

| ID | Type | Title | Severity |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| BUG-XXX | BUG | ... | CRITICAL |
| IMP-XXX | IMP | ... | MEDIUM |
```

Create the `audit-reports/` directory if it doesn't exist.

Also display a summary in the conversation:

```
AUDIT COMPLETE — [project name]
═══════════════════════════════
Mode: [full / incremental (X changed files)]
Duration: [Xm Xs]
Findings: X critical, X high, X medium, X low
Rejected: X false positives
Tickets created: X BUG, X IMP
Feature suggestions: X (for discussion)
Delta: [X new / X resolved / X recurring] (or "first audit")

Full report: audit-reports/[filename].md
```

## Step 8 — .gitignore

After saving the report, check that `audit-reports/` is in `.gitignore`.
If not, add it (audit reports contain security findings — never commit them).

## Rules — NON-NEGOTIABLE

- **Read CLAUDE.md first** — never audit without understanding the project
- **Wait for user confirmation** after presenting the audit plan (Step 2)
- **Never modify source code** — this is an audit, not a fix
- **Never skip CTO verification for CRITICAL/HIGH** — every serious finding must be re-checked
- **Never create FEAT tickets** — features are discussions, not unilateral decisions
- **Always save the report** — findings must persist beyond the conversation
- **Respect existing BACKLOG conventions** — scan IDs, use proper format
- **Audit reports contain sensitive data** — ensure they're gitignored
- **Scale agents to project size** — don't launch 4 agents on a 10-file project
- **Incremental skips exploration** — changed files list IS the map, no Explore agent needed
